# PoliceReports
This technology demonstration pulls a list of recent Raleigh Police Department events (as JSON) from the Open Data Raleigh and displays them on a webpage. I'm using jQuery to pull and clean up the JSON before processing, as well as the Google Static Maps API to show the location of the event. Bootstrap wraps it all up and makes it look pretty.
